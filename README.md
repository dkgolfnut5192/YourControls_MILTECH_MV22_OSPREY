YourControls_MILTECH_MV22_OSPREY

# Version 00.3
   Known Issues:
   - 12/7/2024 PILOT IN COMMAND should operate the engine NACELLES only to maintain synchronization. It isnt perfect but pretty close.

   - 11/5/2024 Make sure you use a very slow click on CDU and PFD buttons so they register. 


 # FIXES:
   11/09/2024 
      - Crrected LANDING GEAR LEVER and PARKING BRAKE HANDLE
   11/05/2024 
     # - Added NACELLES Rotation Synch using code from @TAILHOOK utilizing the  "is_user_event: true"
     # - Validated RAMP and NAV Light synchronization. As noted above a SLOW CLICK with MOUSE button helps the program pick up the button clicks. 
  # - Initial Beta release 10/13/2024

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
